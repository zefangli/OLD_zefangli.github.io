# Biography

I am currently a senior student at [University of Michigan - Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/) (UM-SJTU JI), wiith a major in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science.

My undergraduate studies focus on elastic mechanics, structural health monitoring, and robotics.

I am also an incoming student of Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering - Reaserch program at Carnegie Mellon University in fall 2021, keenly seeking research opportunities on soft robotics and/or wearable electronics.
