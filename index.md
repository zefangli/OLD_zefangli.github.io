## Biography

I obtained bachelor's degree from [University of Michigan - Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/) (UM-SJTU JI) of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, with a major in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science.

My undergraduate studies focus on elastic mechanics, structural health monitoring, and robotics.

I am also an incoming student of [Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering - Reaserch](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/education/graduate-programs/masters-research.html) program at Carnegie Mellon University starting in fall 2021, keenly seeking research opportunities on soft robotics and/or wearable electronics.
